# Installation

We currently support 2 methods of installation:
1. [Installation in an Openshift cluster](./openshift-installation.md) using the [OLM](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager).
1. [Manual installation](./manual-installation.md) in a Kubernetes or Openshift cluster by manually deploying the operator manifests.
   
After the installation, check the [examples](../examples) to deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller using the operator.
