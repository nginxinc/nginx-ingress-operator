Read the [documentation](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-operator/tree/main/docs) and [examples](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-operator/tree/main/examples).

### Project Structure

* This Operator is written in Go using the operator-framework and supports both the open source NGINX Ingress Controller and NGINX Plus Ingress Controller.
* The project follows a standard Go project layout
    * The main code is found at `cmd/manager/`
    * The operator code is found at `pkg/`
    * Build files for Docker and CI are found under `build/`
    * We use [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for managing dependencies.

## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and summarised in the next few points
    * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
    * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
    * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Go Style Guide

* Run `gofmt` over your code to automatically resolve a lot of style issues. Most editors support this running automatically when saving a code file.
* Follow this guide on some good practice and idioms for Go -  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments
* To check for extra issues, install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and run `make lint` or `golangci-lint run`
